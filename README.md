# OpenSource-ScrumTool
This is an Open Source Scrum Tool that was designed as my Final Year project at the University of Hull.

This ASP.NET MVC application is designed to allow users to work by them self or in a team, manage any number of projects and their features & tasks in either a task list style or using Scrum.

The project features colleagues & teams, sprint planning, multi-user live updating and a simple to use scrum board.

The project is avalible for use hosted at http://scrum.markdyer.net
